        success can mean different things. For some learners, success means getting good marks. However, for others, it might mean passing a grade. Our Values: We are our people: the community of learners, tutors and parents all working together. Learning:
        Everything that you don’t know is an opportunity to learn something new or to increase your knowledge. Take pride in, and ownership of, your work. Respect: Treat every person with dignity and good manners. Self-respect: This is where respect begins.
        Kindness: A specific manifestation of respect. Curiosity: Don’t be afraid to ask questions.We cultivate companionship. Care about others. Authenticity and Acceptance – Don’t change who you are. We embrace diversity. Our mission and values are
        embodied in our Code of Conduct. person holding a compass - representing learners finding their way home to Scienza Academy tutor centre Scienza Academy’s Offering Scienza Academy tutor centre offers tutoring for Grade 1 to Grade 12. We use Impaq’s
        products and services and receive academic support from Impaq. Because we tutor in small groups, our learners get the best of both worlds. Learners can engage with their peers and participate in group activities while being able to receive individual
        attention from facilitators. Tutoring from Grade 1 to 12 Schooling is divided into different phases in South Africa. Firstly, the Foundation phase which consists of Grade 1 up to Grade 3. Secondly, the Intermediate phase from Grade 4 until the
        end of Grade 6. After completing the intermediate phase learners progress to the Senior Phase – Grade 7 until Grade 9. The final phase of high school in South Africa is the Further Education and Training (FET) phase from Grade 10 to Grade 12.
        From Start to Finish Foundation Phase The first phase is all about laying the groundwork for future learning. Initial subjects include English, Afrikaans, Mathematics and Life Skills. At Scienza our foundation learners are grouped together to
        ensure that they get the best possible start. Intermediate Phase Starting in Grade 4, learners move onto the intermediate phase. During this phase, learners begin to develop their skills to write formal assessments. In other words, they start
        writing exams. Additionally, students begin to learn about Social Sciences and Natural Science and Technology. Grade fours and fives learn together, getting lessons from three different tutors. This allows Scienza’s learners to adapt to the increased
        intensity of more formal schooling. From Grade 6 and above, learners are taught by different tutors. This allows the learners to begin to adapt to being taught more complex tasks by tutors who have a narrower range of focus. Senior Phase The final
        compulsory phase of South African education begins in Grade 7 and ends in Grade 9. Subjects studied during these years include Economic and Management Sciences, Technology and Creative Arts. During Grade 7 to 9 learners are taught the basics that
        will be expanded on when they choose their subject specialisations for the FET phase. This is the last phase where subjects are grouped together. So, in Grade 7 to 9 learners will still have the subject Social Science that comprises of History
        and Geography. Creative Arts takes up the performing role from English and lays the foundation for Dramatic Arts and Visual Arts in Grade 10. Economic and Management Sciences consists of the basics of Business Management, Economics and Accountancy.
        Further Education and Training Phase This final phase opens many doors, including those of college and university. After completing Grade 9, learners are able to focus on specific subjects in order to complete their matric. Although choosing subjects
        can be daunting, Scienza Academy’s tutors will happily guide learners about which subjects they can take. Subject Offered During Grade 10 to 12, learners must take a minimum of seven subjects. Compulsory subjects English Home Language Afrikaans
        First Additional Language (Eerste Addisionele Taal) Mathematics OR Mathematical Literacy Life Orientation Optional Subjects Consumer Studies (May not be taken with Hospitality Studies) Computer Application Technology (CAT) Dramatic Arts Engineering
        & Graphics Design (EGD) Geography History Life Sciences (Previously known as Biology) Physical Sciences (Combination of Physics and Chemistry) – Requires Mathematics Tourism Visual Arts Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting
        of a fire Socrates How Scienza Academy Works We are a tutor centre that is registered with Impaq. Scienza uses Impaq’s products and services as the basis for our tutoring. Learners benefit from interactive tutoring and exam preparation. Our learners
        wear casual clothes each day. Learners register with both Impaq and Scienza Academy. In terms of South African legislation, homeschooling must take place at a learner’s home, which means that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that a learner
        receives an education is vested with the parent or guardian. Impaq issues the Learner’s reports. Because of the legal definition of homeschooling up until the end of Grade 9, both the learner’s guardian and Scienza have access to all of the learner’s
        assessment material. From Grade 10 Impaq requires that exams are invigilated by an approved invigilator. Scienza Academy is an approved invigilator with Impaq. At the end of Grade 12, a learner receives their matric certificate through Umalusi.
        Scienza helps learners to develop their skills so that they can work independently. We acknowledge that everyone is different and work to accommodate different learning styles. Daily Schedule (Outside of tests and exams) Grade Start Time End Time
